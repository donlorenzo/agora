<h1>Agora - Developer Documentation</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h2>High-Level Design</h2>
Agora's main component is called the core. It interacts with the outside world through several API interfaces:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#ui_api">UI API</a></li>
  <li><a href="#plugin_api">Plugin API</a></li>
  <li><a href="#config_api">Configuration API</a></li>
  <li><a href="#file_api">File Access API</a></li>
</ul>
In addition agora defines a <a href="#binary_wire_protocol">binary protocol</a> with which it communicates with other agora instances.

<h3 id="ui_api">The UI API</h3>
The UI API consists of two parts
<ul>
  <li>Core UI API</li>
  <li>Client UI API</li>
</ul>
The Agora core implements the Core UI API and injects itself into the client which in turn must implement the Client UI API.

<h4>The Core UI API</h4>
The Core UI API exposes Agora's administrative functionality to the Client UI Adapter.

<h4>The Client UI API</h4>
The Client UI API must be implemented by Client UI Adapters to be able to be loaded by the Agora Core.
It provides functionality to inform the UI about changes in the core.

<h3 id="plugin_api">The Plugin API</h3>
The Plugin API consists of two parts
<ul>
  <li>Core Plugin API</li>
  <li>Client Plugin API</li>
</ul>
The Agora core implements the Core Plugin API and injects itself into the client which in turn must implement the Client Plugin API.

<h4>The Core Plugin API</h4>
Agora exposes certain functionality to Plugins through the Core Plugin API. This includes
<ul>
  <li>opening a connection to a remote Agora node</li>
  <li>sending/receiving data to/from a remote Agora node</li>
  <li>adding Plugin specific controls to the UI and keeping it up to date</li>
</ul>
